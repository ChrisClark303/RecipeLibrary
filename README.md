# RecipeLibrary
 
This is a project I used to implement some of the things I learned from the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial. It's pretty "warts and all".

Since I enjoy cooking, the idea is to turn this into something that can be used at home to store favourite recipes and suggest them by searching for certain criteria, for example, to feed in ingredients that you have in the fridge and be able to find recipes that match those. Other deatures I'd like is for it to be able to suggest random recipies (similar to Google's "I feel lucky"!) and to generate a shopping list based on recipes the user has selected.
